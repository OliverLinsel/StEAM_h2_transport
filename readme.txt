On the way to meet the Paris climate goals, hydrogen and its derivates can contribute to a defossilized global energy system.
Beside the production of hydrogen, the transport is a key component to a successful development of a decarbonized global hydrogen economy.
As it is not yet clear where the required amounts of hydrogen will be produced and along which routes and in which form, they will be transported a global hydrogen energy system model needs to be established that supports structured analysis and help gain insights across sectors.
This study provides a highly flexible approach for geographical structuring of sector integrated energy transport systems.
It allows for the development of energy system networks within any geographical area on earth provided the basic system nodes and the subsequent provision of key data for energy system modelling.
Through subsequent data processing the data structure of the model parameters can be adapted to meet the requirements of the respective energy system modelling framework.
Thus, enabling the setup of energy transport systems to perform structured investigation of origin and transport in a future hydrogen economy.

Quickstart guide:
1. Download repository
2. Install required packages through env "geo_tools.yml"
3. Install Spine https://github.com/spine-tools
4. Open script in python development envirnoment
5. Change desired parameters and node datasets
6. Execute the script until after export of "transport_objects.xlsx"
