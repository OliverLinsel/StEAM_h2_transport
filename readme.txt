Beside the production of hydrogen, the transport is a key component to a successful development of a decarbonized global hydrogen economy. To answer the question, where the required amounts of hydrogen will be produced and along which routes and in which form they will be transported, a global hydrogen energy system model is established that supports structured analysis and help gain insights across sectors. This paper provides a flexible method and tool for geographical structuring of sector integrated energy transport systems. It allows for the development of energy system networks within any geographical scope provided the system nodes and key parameters. Through subsequent data processing the data structure of the model parameters is adapted to meet the requirements of the respective energy system modelling framework. Thus, enabling the setup of energy transport systems to perform structured investigation of origin and transport in a future hydrogen economy.
